Syslinux Regression Tests

This directory contains acceptance or regression tests. Each test is
intended to exercise a specific execution path through Syslinux, from
user input to output. Unit tests are located in a module directory, e.g.
com32/lib/syslinux/tests/, and test a specific "unit" of code such as a
function or interface.

The regression tests are intended to be run on the development
environment. As such they must remain fast.

Qemu must be installed and we grab OVMF from a predetermined location.

If you're thinking of rewriting or refactoring a subsystem in a major
way, please ensure there is a suitable test, and if not, write one.
